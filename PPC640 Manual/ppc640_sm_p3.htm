  following:<br>
  (1) Seek increment or alternate tracks<br>

  (3) Write 1 F or 2F (All 0's or 1 's)<br>
  (4) Recalibration to track 00

  2. DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES</b>
  <p><b>
  2.1 Error Symptom Recognition</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
  Errors that occur because of the wrong operating procedure, wrong programming, or use of a defective diskette, or soft errors
    due to external causes, such as contaminated air and random electrical noise, are often attributed to a drive failure.
    Unless a visual inspection of the drive reveals an evident assembly fault or a defect,
    <b> always confirm errors with another good diskette, and another known good
    drive</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>
  2.2  Soft Error Detection and Correction</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
  Soft errors are normally caused by the following:<br>
  (1 ) Contamination between read/write heads and diskette. This kind of contamination can be easily eliminated by the liner in
    the diskette. Contaminated heads can be cleaned by a general purpose non-abrasive head cleaning diskette. Please follow the
    suitable procedure provided with the cleaning diskette.<br>
  (2) Random electrical noise, normally a few microseconds or less.<br>
  (3) Small defects in written data and/or track not detected during write operation may cause soft errors during
    read.<br>
  (4) Faulty grounding of the drive or host system can also cause a soft error.<br>
  (5) Wrong motor speed is another cause of soft errors.<br>
  Take the following steps on the controller side to recover from the soft errors mentioned
    above.<br>
  (1) Read the track again ten times or until the data is recovered.<br>
  (2) If Step (1) above fails to recover the data, access the adjacent track. Then return the head to the original track.<br>
  (3) Repeat Step (1 ).<br>
  (4) Any error that cannot be corrected by the above procedure is irrecoverable.<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>
  2.3  Write Error</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
  If an error occurs during write operation, it is usually detected during the next revolution by performing a read operation called
    write check. To correct an error, write again and repeat a write check operation. If the result is unsatisfactory after ten or more
    write operations, perform a read operation on another track to determine whether it is the diskette or the drive that is
    wrong.
  If an error persists, replace the diskette and repeat the above procedure. If the error still persists, consider the drive defective. If
  the error is corrected, dispose of the diskette as defective.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>
  2.4 Read Error</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
  Most read errors are soft errors. Data can be recovered by following the recovery procedure mentioned in 2.2.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>
  2.5  Seek Error</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
  (1) Stepper motor or stepper motor circuit drive is faulty.<br>
  (2) Faulty Carriage&nbsp;<br>
    There are two ways of seek error recovery. One is to recalibrate to track 00, and seek back to the original track. The other is to
    read the ID field, check the track number on which the head is located, and move the head away from it. And read it
    again.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>
  2.6  Interchangeability Error</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
  Data which is written by one drive may not be read by another. This error is called an Interchangeability error, which can be<br>
  caused mostly by the following reason, which should be checked as follows.<br>
  <br>
  (1) Head misalignment: Refer to Adjustments and Confirmation Item 5.5<br>
  (2) Head output too low: Refer to Adjustments and Confirmation Item 5.3<br>
  (3) Motor speed difference: Refer to Adjustments and Confirmation Item 5.1<br>
    (4) Format difference<br>
  <br>
