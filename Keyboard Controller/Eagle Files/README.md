# Eagle Files

The schematic and board files were created in Eagle v9.0.1

The Gerber files are generated and named for use with http://www.dirtypcbs.com

The board measures out to 4cm x 5.5cm. Can't get it any smaller because of the Teensy++ board.
You will have to use the 10cm x 10cm option, but you can get the proto-pack for $25 shipped

If ANYONE else wants to do the same type of conversion, I have spare boards I'd be will to part with for the cost of shipping. The protopack I ordered came with 12 boards.
