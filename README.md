Replacement keyboard for an Amstrad PPC640 luggable

Project is pending arrival of actual PPC640. This is a best guess as to a replacement keyboard layout, based on standard key sizes and photos of unit.


The Keyboard Controller directory contain info on converting the existing keyboard to talk USB for use with a modern system. Gerber and schematic files are available in the directory also.
